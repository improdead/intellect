# Video Generation with LangChain and LangGraph

This document explains the implementation of the video generation feature using LangChain, LangGraph, and Gemini 2.0 Pro.

## Architecture Overview

The video generation system uses a sophisticated pipeline that combines multiple AI models and specialized services:

1. **Frontend Interface**: Chat interface where users can request video generation
2. **API Layer**: Next.js API routes that handle video generation requests
3. **LangGraph Workflow**: Orchestrates the video generation process
4. **LangChain Components**: Handles script generation and content structuring
5. **AI Models**: Uses Gemini 2.0 Pro for script generation

## Components

### 1. Frontend (components/chat-interface-redesigned.tsx)

The chat interface allows users to:
- Request video generation on any topic
- See real-time progress updates
- View the final video when generation is complete

The implementation uses a polling mechanism to check the status of video generation jobs.

### 2. API Layer (app/api/video-generation/route.ts)

The API provides two endpoints:
- `POST /api/video-generation`: Starts a new video generation job
- `GET /api/video-generation?jobId={id}`: Gets the status of a job

The API uses an in-memory store for job status (would use a database in production).

### 3. LangChain Implementation (lib/langchain/video-generation.ts)

This module provides:
- Script generation using Gemini 2.0 Pro
- Structured output parsing with Zod schemas
- Functions for generating visuals, animations, and narration

### 4. LangGraph Workflow (lib/langgraph/video-workflow.ts)

The workflow orchestrates the video generation process:
1. Script generation
2. Visual generation
3. Animation generation
4. Narration generation
5. Video composition

The workflow handles errors and provides status updates throughout the process.

## How It Works

1. User requests a video on a topic
2. Frontend sends a request to the API
3. API creates a job and starts the LangGraph workflow
4. Workflow generates script using Gemini 2.0 Pro
5. Workflow processes script into segments
6. Workflow generates visuals, animations, and narration
7. Workflow composes the final video
8. Frontend polls for status updates and displays the video when ready

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Timeouts for long-running processes
- Fallbacks for failed components
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Future Improvements

1. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory storage with a database
2. **Caching**: Implement caching for generated assets
3. **Parallel Processing**: Use Ray for distributed processing
4. **Advanced Monitoring**: Add detailed logging and monitoring
5. **User Customization**: Allow users to customize video style and content

## Dependencies

- LangChain: For AI model integration and content generation
- LangGraph: For workflow orchestration
- Gemini 2.0 Pro: For script generation
- Eleven Labs: For voice narration (simulated in current implementation)
- Next.js: For API routes and frontend

## Usage

To use the video generation feature:
1. Type a topic in the chat input
2. Click the "Video Generation" tool
3. Wait for the video to be generated
4. View and interact with the video in the chat

## Technical Details

The implementation uses:
- TypeScript for type safety
- React for the frontend
- Next.js API routes for the backend
- LangChain for AI model integration
- LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- Zod for schema validation
